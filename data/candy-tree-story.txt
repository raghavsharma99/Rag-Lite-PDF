The whispering Maplewood forest always smelled like cinnamon mornings, but nobody knew why until young Mira skipped past the creek and found a tree glistening with sugar-glass leaves. Each branch shimmered with raspberry swirls, chocolate bark, and gumdrop buds that twinkled like lanterns, and the tree hummed a lullaby that sounded suspiciously like a candy shop doorbell.

When Mira plucked a caramel blossom, it unlocked a secret path of jellybean stepping-stones that led deeper into the woods where fireflies wore peppermint stripes. The animals gathered politely—squirrels in marshmallow scarves and owls with licorice spectacles—waiting for Mira to let them taste the new treat. Sharing tiny pieces made the tree giggle, and more sweets bloomed in rainbow ripples.

By sunset the forest orchestra joined in, from the toffee drum of rain on leaves to the lemon-drop chime of wind through branches, and Maplewood learned that kindness makes the candy tree glow brightest. Mira promised to visit every full moon, keeping the secret safe so the tree could keep lighting the woods for dreamers who still believe in sugar-coated wishes.
